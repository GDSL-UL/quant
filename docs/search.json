    "text": "Aim and Learning Objectives\nThis sub-module aims to provide training and skills on a set of basic quantitative skills for data collection, analysis, and interpretation and to enable you to link conceptual ideas with real world examples. This block serves as the foundation for Year 2 BA field class and, optionally, for Year 3 dissertation.\nBackground\nData and research are key pillars of the global economy and society today. We need rigorous approaches to collecting and analysing both the statistics that can tell us ‘how much’ and if there are observable relationships between phenomena; and the information gives us a nuanced understanding of cultural contexts and human dynamics. Quantitative skills enable us to explore and measure socio-economic activities and processes at large scales, while qualitative skills enable understanding of social, cultural, and political contexts and diverse lived experiences. Rather than being in opposition, qualitative and quantitative research can complement one another in the investigation of today’s pressing research questions.\nTo these ends, this block will help you develop your quantitative skills, as critical tools. This course will help you understand what quantitative statistical researchers use and develop a set of research techniques that can be used in your field classes and dissertations.\nLearning objectives:",

    "section": "1.2 Getting set up with RStudio",
    "text": "1.2 Getting set up with RStudio\n\n1.2.1 Install R and RStudio (if necessary)\nR is a free, open-source programming language used for statistical analysis, data visualization, and data science\nRStudio is a free front-end to R, designed to make using R easier\nAll of the PCs in the University PC Teaching Centre used for this class come with R and RStudio pre-installed, as do the PCs in many other University PC Teaching Centres.\nHowever, you may wish to install R and RStudio on your own computer, or on a University PC that lacks them.\nUniversity computers: Use the Install University Applications app on the computer to install the latest version of RStudio (this will also install the latest version of R)\nYour own computer: R and RStudio can be downloaded from the CRAN website and installed your own computer - see below for details. A key point is that you should install R before you install RStudio.\nThe simplest way to get R installed on your computer is to go the download pages on the R website - a quick search for `download R’ should take you there, but if not you could try:\n\nWindows: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/\nMac: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/\nLinux: http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/\n\nThe Windows and Mac version come with installer packages and are easy to install whilst the Linux binaries require use of a command terminal.\nRStudio can be downloaded from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ and the free version of RStudio Desktop is more than sufficient for this module and all the other things you will to do at degree level.\nIf you experience any problems installing R or RStudio on your own computer, bring it to one of the class lab sessions where we will be able to provide advice.\n\n\n1.2.2 File management\nBefore you start installing software or downloading data, create a folder on your M-Drive (if working on a University networked machine) or locally if working on your own device – name this ‘ENVS162’ and within this create a sub-folder for each practical session. For this session, create a sub-folder called Week1 in your ENVS162 folder on your M-Drive. Take care to ensure you do not delete any work you do complete in the practical sessions. It is imperative that you practice good file management!\n\n\n1.2.3 Open RStudio\nRStudio provides an interface to the different things that R can do via the 4 panes: the Console where code is entered (bottom left), a Source pane with R scripts (top left), the variables in the working Environment (top right), Files, Plots, Help etc (bottom right) - see the RStudio environment in Figure below.\nIn the figure above of the RStudio interface, a new script has been opened, a line of code had been written and then run in the console. The code assigns a value of 100 to x. The file has been saved into the current working environment. You are expected to define a similar set up for each practical as you work through the code. Note that in the script, anything that follows a # is a comment and ignored by R.\nUsers can set up their personal preferences for how they like their RStudio interface. Similar to straight R, there are very few pull-down menus in R, and therefore you will type lines of code into your script and run these in what is termed a command line interface (the console). Like all command line interfaces, the learning curve is steep but the interaction with the software is more detailed which allows greater flexibility and precision in the specification of commands.\nBeyond this there are further choices to be made. Commands can be entered in two forms: directly into the R console window or as a series of commands into a script window. We strongly advise that all code should be written in a script - (a .R file) and then run from the script. - To run code in a script, place the cursor on the line of code and then run by pressing the ‘Run’ icon at the top left of the script pane, or by pressing Ctrl Enter (PC) (or Cmd Enter on a Mac).\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Ways of working\nThe first set of consideration relate to how you should work in R/RStudio. The key things to remember are:\n\nR is a learning curve if you have never done anything like this before. It can be scary. It can be intimidating. But once you have a bit of familiarity with how things work, it is incredibly powerful.\nYou will be working from practical worksheets which will have all the code you need. Your job is to try to understand what the code is doing and not to remember the code. Comments in your code really help.\nTo help you do this, the very strong suggestion is use the R scripts that are provided, and that you add your own comments to help you understand what is going on when you return to them. Comments are prefaced by a hash (#) that is ignored by R. Then you can save your code (with comments), run it and return to it later and modify at your leisure.\n\nThe module places a strong emphasis placed on learning by doing, which means that you encouraged to unpick the code that you are given, adapt it and play with it. It is not about remembering or being able to recall each function used but about understanding what is being done. If you can remember what you did previously (i.e. the operations you undertook) and understand what you did, you will be able to return to your code the next time you want to do something similar. To help you with this you should:\n\nAlways run your code from an R script… always! These are provided for each practical;\nAnnotate you scripts with comments. These are prefixed by a hash (#) in the code;\nSave your R script to your folder;\n\n::: {#To summarise} To summarise…\n\nYou should always use a script (a text file containing code) for your code which can be saved and then re-run at a later date.\nYou can write your own code into a script, copy and paste code into it or use an existing script (for example as provided for each of the R/RStudio practicals in this module).\nTo open a new R script go to File &gt; New File &gt; R Script to open a new R file, and save it with a sensible name.\nTo load an existing script file go to File &gt; Open File and then navigate to your file. Or, if you have recently opened the file, go to File &gt; Recent Files &gt;.\nIt is good practice to set the working directory at the beginning of your R session. This can be done via the menu in RStudio Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; …. This points the R session to the folder you choose and will ensure that any files you wish to read, write or save are placed in this directory.\nTo run code in a script, place the cursor on the line of code and then run by pressing the ‘Run’ icon at the top left of the script pane, or by pressing Ctrl Enter (PC) or Cmd Enter (Mac). :::\n\n\n\n1.2.5 Your first R code\nIn this section you will undertake a few generic operations. You will:\n\nundertake assignment: the allocation of values to an R object.\nuse assignment to create a vector of elements and a matrix of elements.\nundertake operations on R objects.\napply some functions to R objects (functions nearly always return a value).\naccess some of R in-built data to examine a data table (or data.frame which is like an Excel spreadsheet).\ndo some basic plotting, including scatter plots and histograms.\ncreate data summaries.\n\nOn the way you will also be introduced to indexing.\nFirst, you should create a new R script (see above) and save it as week1.R in the working directory you are using for this practical. This should be the Week1 sub-directory you created in the GEOG162 folder. Note that you should create a separate folder for each week’s practical.\n\n1.2.5.1 Assignment\nThe command line prompt in the Console window, the &gt;, is an invitation to start typing in your commands.\nWrite the following into your script: 3+5 and run it. Recall that code is run done by either by pressing the Run icon at the top left of the script pane, or by pressing Ctrl Enter (PC) or Cmd Enter (Mac).\n\n3+5\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nHere the result is 8. The [1] that precedes the output it formally indicates, first requested element will follow. In this case there is just one element. The &gt; indicates that R is ready for another command.\nNow type the following in to your script and run it:\n\ny &lt;- 3+5\ny\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nHere the value of the 3+5 has been assigned to y. The syntax y &lt;- 3+5 can be read as y gets 3+5. When y is invoked its value is returned (8).\nFor the purposes of this module, in R the equals sign (=) is the same as &lt;-, a left diamond bracket &lt; followed by a minus sign -. This too is interpreted by R as is assigned to or gets when the code is read right to left.\nNow copy and paste the following into your R script and run both lines:\n\nx &lt;- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8), nrow = 4)\ny = matrix(1:8, nrow = 4, byrow = T)\n\nYou should see the x appear with the y in the Environment pane. y has now been overwritten with a new assignment. If you click on the icon next to them, you will get a ‘spreadsheet’ view of the data you have created.\nOf course you can also enter the following in the console and see what is returned:\n\nx\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    5\n[2,]    2    6\n[3,]    3    7\n[4,]    4    8\n\ny\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    2\n[2,]    3    4\n[3,]    5    6\n[4,]    7    8\n\n\nNote In the code snippets above you have used parentheses - round brackets. Different kinds of brackets are used in different ways in R. Parentheses are used with functions, and contain the arguments that are passed to the function, separated by commas (,).\nIn this case the functions are c() and matrix(). The function c() combines or concatenates elements into a vector, and matrix() creates a matrix of elements in a tabular format.\nIn the line of code x = matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8), nrow = 4), the arguments passed to the matrix() function are the vector of values c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) and nrow = 4. Other kinds of brackets are used in different ways as you will see later.\nOne final thing to note is that the matrix is y is has the numbers 1 to 8, but this is specified by 1:8. Try entering 3:65, 19:11, and 1.5:5 to see how the colon (:) works in this context.\n\n\n1.2.5.2 Operations\nNow you can undertake operations on R objects and apply functions to them. Write the following code into your script and then run it:\n\n# x is a matrix\nx\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    5\n[2,]    2    6\n[3,]    3    7\n[4,]    4    8\n\n# multiplication\nx*2\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    2   10\n[2,]    4   12\n[3,]    6   14\n[4,]    8   16\n\n# sum of x\nsum(x)\n\n[1] 36\n\n# mean of x\nmean(x)\n\n[1] 4.5\n\n\nOperations can be undertaken directly using mathematical notation like * for multiplication or using functions like max to find the maximum value in an R object.\n\n\n1.2.5.3 Functions\nFunctions are always followed by parenthesis (round brackets) ( ). These are different from square and curly brackets [ ] and { }. Functions always return something, a result if you like, and have the generic form:\n\n# don't run this or write this into your script!\nresult = function(value or R object, other parameters)\n\nDo not run or enter this code in your script - it is an example!\n\n\n1.2.5.4 Data Tables\nHere we will load a data table in data.frame (like a spreadsheet) in R/RStudio. R has number of in-built datasets that we can use the code below loads one of these:\n\ndata(mtcars)\nclass(mtcars)\n\n[1] \"data.frame\"\n\n\nHave a look at what is loaded by listing the objects in the current R session\n\nls()\n\n[1] \"mtcars\" \"x\"      \"y\"     \n\n\nYou should see the mtcars object.

The columns in data frames can be of different types: vectors of numbers, factors (classes) or text strings. In matrices all of the columns have to be off the same type. Data frames are central to what we will do in R.\n\n\n1.2.5.5 Plotting the data: ‘Hello World!’\nThe code below creates a plot of 2 variables counts in the data: mpg and disp.\n\nplot(disp ~ mpg,  data = mtcars, pch=16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option pch=16 sets the plotting character to a solid black dot. More plot characters are available - examine the help for points() to see these:\n\n?points\n\nstarting httpd help server ... done\n\n\nThis plot can be improved greatly. We can specify more informative axis labels, change size of the text and of the plotting symbol, and so on.\nWe can also specify the same plot by passing named variables to the plot function directly as well as other parameters, as in the figure. Notice how the syntax for this is different to the plot function above, and the different parameters that are passed to the plot() function:\n\nplot(x = mtcars$mpg, y = mtcars$disp,   pch = 1, col = \"dodgerblue\", \n     cex = 1.5, xlab = \"Miles per Gallon\", ylab = \"Displacement\", \n     main = \"Hello World!\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: A scatter plot.\nNotice how the dollar sign ($) is used to access variables in the mtcars data table compared to the first plot command, which specified data = mtcars.\n\n\n1.2.5.6 Data summaries and indexing\nWe may for example require information on variables in mtcars. The summary function is very useful:\n\nsummary(mtcars)\n\n      mpg             cyl             disp             hp       \n Min.   :10.40   Min.   :4.000   Min.   : 71.1   Min.   : 52.0  \n 1st Qu.:15.43   1st Qu.:4.000   1st Qu.:120.8   1st Qu.: 96.5  \n Median :19.20   Median :6.000   Median :196.3   Median :123.0  \n Mean   :20.09   Mean   :6.188   Mean   :230.7   Mean   :146.7  \n 3rd Qu.:22.80   3rd Qu.:8.000   3rd Qu.:326.0   3rd Qu.:180.0  \n Max.   :33.90   Max.   :8.000   Max.   :472.0   Max.   :335.0  \n      drat             wt             qsec             vs        \n Min.   :2.760   Min.   :1.513   Min.   :14.50   Min.   :0.0000  \n 1st Qu.:3.080   1st Qu.:2.581   1st Qu.:16.89   1st Qu.:0.0000  \n Median :3.695   Median :3.325   Median :17.71   Median :0.0000  \n Mean   :3.597   Mean   :3.217   Mean   :17.85   Mean   :0.4375  \n 3rd Qu.:3.920   3rd Qu.:3.610   3rd Qu.:18.90   3rd Qu.:1.0000  \n Max.   :4.930   Max.   :5.424   Max.   :22.90   Max.   :1.0000  \n       am              gear            carb      \n Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :3.000   Min.   :1.000  \n 1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.:3.000   1st Qu.:2.000  \n Median :0.0000   Median :4.000   Median :2.000  \n Mean   :0.4062   Mean   :3.688   Mean   :2.812  \n 3rd Qu.:1.0000   3rd Qu.:4.000   3rd Qu.:4.000  \n Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :5.000   Max.   :8.000  \n\n\nThis shows different summaries of the individual attributes in mtcars.\nThe main R graphics function is plot(). In addition to plot() there are functions for adding points and lines to existing graphs, for placing text at specified positions, for specifying tick marks and tick labels, for labelling axes, and so on.\nThere are various other alternative helpful forms of graphical summary. A helpful graphical summary for the mtcars data frame is the scatterplot matrix, shown in Figure 1.4.\n\n# return the names of the mtcars variables\nnames(mtcars)\n\n [1] \"mpg\"  \"cyl\"  \"disp\" \"hp\"   \"drat\" \"wt\"   \"qsec\" \"vs\"   \"am\"   \"gear\"\n[11] \"carb\"\n\n\n\n# return the 3rd to 7th names\nnames(mtcars)[c(3:7)]\n\n[1] \"disp\" \"hp\"   \"drat\" \"wt\"   \"qsec\"\n\n\n\n# check what this does\nc(3:7)\n\n[1] 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\n\n# plot the 3rd to 7th variables in mtcars\nplot(mtcars[, c(3:7)], cex = 0.5, \n     col = \"red\", upper.panel=panel.smooth)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Multiple scatterplots.\nThe results show the correlations between the variables in the mtcars data frame, and the trend of their relationship is included with the upper.panel=panel.smooth parameter passed to plot.\nThere are number of things to notice here (as well as the figure). In particular note the use of the vector c(2:7) to subset the columns of mtcars:\n\nIn the second line, this is was used to subset the vector of column names created by names(mtcars).\nIn the third line, it was printed out. Notice how 3:7 printed out all the number between 3 and 7 - very useful.\nFor the plot, the vector was passed to the second argument, after the comma, in the square brackets [,] to indicate which columns were to be plotted.\n\nThe referencing in this way (or indexing) is very important: the individual rows and columns of 2 dimensional data structures like data frames, matrices, tibbles etc can be accessed by passing references to them in the square brackets.\n\n# 1st row\nmtcars[1,]\n\n          mpg cyl disp  hp drat   wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nMazda RX4  21   6  160 110  3.9 2.62 16.46  0  1    4    4\n\n# 3rd column\nmtcars[,3]\n\n [1] 160.0 160.0 108.0 258.0 360.0 225.0 360.0 146.7 140.8 167.6 167.6 275.8\n[13] 275.8 275.8 472.0 460.0 440.0  78.7  75.7  71.1 120.1 318.0 304.0 350.0\n[25] 400.0  79.0 120.3  95.1 351.0 145.0 301.0 121.0\n\n# a selection of rows\nmtcars[c(3:5,8),]\n\n                   mpg cyl  disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nDatsun 710        22.8   4 108.0  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1\nHornet 4 Drive    21.4   6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1\nHornet Sportabout 18.7   8 360.0 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2\nMerc 240D         24.4   4 146.7  62 3.69 3.190 20.00  1  0    4    2\n\n\nSuch indexing could of course have been assigned to a R object and used to do the subsetting:\n\nx = c(3:7)\nnames(mtcars)[x]\n\n[1] \"disp\" \"hp\"   \"drat\" \"wt\"   \"qsec\"\n\nplot(mtcars[,x], cex = 0.5, col = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus indexing allows specific rows and columns to be extracted from the data as required.\nNote You have encountered a second type of brackets, square brackets [ ]. These are used to reference or index positions in a vector or a data table.\nConsider the object x above. It contains a vector of values, 3,4,5,6,7. Entering x[1] would extract the first element of x, in this case 3. Similarly x[4] would return the 4th element and x[c(1,4)] would return the 1st and 4th elements of x.\nHowever, in the examples above that index the 2-dimensional mtcars object, the square brackets are used to index row and column positions. The syntax for this is [rows, columns]. We will be using such indexing throughout this module.\n\n\n1.2.5.7 Packages\nThe base installation of R includes many functions and commands. However, more often we are interested in using some particular functionality, encoded into packages contributed by the R developer community. Installing packages for the first time can be done at the command line in the R console using the install.packages command as in the example below to install the tmap library or via the RStudio menu via Tools &gt; Install Packages.\nWhen you install these packages it is strongly suggested you also install the dependencies. These are other packages that are required by the package that is being installed. This can be done by selecting check the box in the menu or including dep=TRUE in the command line as below (don’t run this yet!):\n\n# don't run this!\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\", dep = TRUE)\n\nYou may have to set a mirror site from which the packages will be downloaded to your computer. Generally you should pick one that is nearby to you.\nFurther descriptions of packages, their installation and their data structures will be given as needed in the practicals. There are literally 1000s of packages that have been contributed to the R project by various researchers and organisations. These can be located by name at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html if you know the package you wish to use. It is also possible to search the CRAN website to find packages to perform particular tasks at http://www.r-project.org/search.html. Additionally many packages include user guides and vignettes as well as a PDF document describing the package and listed at the top of the index page of the help files for the package.\nAs well as tidyverse you should install the sf package and dependencies. So we have 2 packages to install:\n\nsf for spatial data and spatial objects\ntidyverse for lots of lovely data science things - see https://www.tidyverse.org\n\nYou could do this in one go and this will take a bit of time:\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"sf\", \"tidyverse\"), dep = TRUE)\n\nRemember: you will only have to install a package once!! So when the above code has run in your script you should comment it out. For example you might want to include something like the below in your R script.\n\n# packages only need to be loaded once\n# install.packages(c(\"sf\", \"tidyverse\"), dep = TRUE)\n\nOnce the package has been installed on your computer then the package can be called using the library() function into each of your R sessions as below.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nWarning: package 'tidyverse' was built under R version 4.5.2\n\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.5.1\n\n\nWarning: package 'tibble' was built under R version 4.5.1\n\n\nWarning: package 'tidyr' was built under R version 4.5.1\n\n\nWarning: package 'readr' was built under R version 4.5.1\n\n\nWarning: package 'purrr' was built under R version 4.5.1\n\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.5.1\n\n\nWarning: package 'forcats' was built under R version 4.5.1\n\n\nWarning: package 'lubridate' was built under R version 4.5.1\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.2\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.2     ✔ tibble    3.3.0\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.1.0     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(sf)\n\nWarning: package 'sf' was built under R version 4.5.1\n\n\nLinking to GEOS 3.13.1, GDAL 3.11.0, PROJ 9.6.0; sf_use_s2() is TRUE",

    "section": "1.3 Knowing Merseyside",
    "text": "1.3 Knowing Merseyside\n\n1.3.1 Merseyside districts\nNow we use these basic R command and newly installed packages to start our initial exploration by using some existing secondary dataset from the Census 2021.\nIn R we normally read in tabular dataset from .csv format. In your Week 1 data folder, you can find one .csv dataset: merseyside.csv. You can open them in excel to have a look, but here we are using R instead of Excel to load and examine them.\n\n1.3.1.1 Loading tabular data\nThe survey data can be loaded into RStudio using the read.csv function.\nHowever, you will need to tell R where to get the data from. The easiest way to do this is to use the menu if the R script file is open. Go to Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; To Source File Location to set the working directory to the location where your week1.R script is saved. When you do this you will see line of code print out in the Console (bottom left pane) similar to setwd(\"SomeFilePath\"). You can copy this line of code to your script and paste into the line above the line calling the read.csv function.\n\n# use read.csv to load a CSV file\n# this is assignment to an object called `df`\ndf = read.csv(file = \"merseyside.csv\", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)\n\nThe stringsAsFactors = TRUE parameter tells R to read any character or text variables as classes or categories and not as just text.\nYou could inspect the help for the read.csv function to see the different parameters and their default values:\n\nhelp(read.csv)\n# or \n?read.csv\n\nFunctions always return something and in this case read.csv() function has returned a tabular R object with 5 records and 14 fields. This has been assigned to df.\nFinally in this section, lets have a look at the data. This can be done in a number of ways.\n\nyou could look at the df object by entering df in the Console. However this is not particular helpful as it simply prints out everything that is in df to the Console.\nyou could click on the df object in the Environment pane and this shows the structure of the

This is used to refer to or extract an individual named field or variable in an R object, like df.\nThe code below prints out the Population attribute and generates a summary of its values:\n\n# extract an individual variable\ndf$Population\n\n[1] 154519 486088 183248 279233 320199\n\n\n\n# generate a summary of an individual variable\nsummary(df$Population)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

The code below extracts three variables from df, assigns them to x, y and z, and then uses the data.frame function to convert these into a new data.frame object called my_df\n\n# extract three variables, assigning them to temporary R objects\nx = df$District\ny = df$Working.population\nz = df$Full.time.students\n# create a data.frame from these, naming the new variables\nmy_df = data.frame(district = x,worker = y,student = z)\n\nYou should have a look at what you have created:\n\nhead(my_df)\n\n    district worker student\n1   Knowsley  69495    7050\n2  Liverpool 205749   59628\n3 St. Helens  82622    7582\n4     Sefton 124596   12636\n5     Wirral 139500   14642\n\n\n\nsummary(my_df)\n\n       district     worker          student     \n Knowsley  :1   Min.   : 69495   Min.   : 7050  \n Liverpool :1   1st Qu.: 82622   1st Qu.: 7582  \n Sefton    :1   Median :124596   Median :12636  \n St. Helens:1   Mean   :124392   Mean   :20308  \n Wirral    :1   3rd Qu.:139500   3rd Qu.:14642  \n                Max.   :205749   Max.   :59628  \n\n\nThe temporary R objects can be removed from the Environment using the rm function and a combine vector function, c() that you encountered in Week 19, that takes a vector of object names (hence they are in quotes) as its arguments.\n\nrm(list = c(\"x\",\"y\",\"z\"))\n\n\n\n1.3.1.2 Basic data manipulation\nNow we can do some basic data manipulation to know Merseyside more from the data perspective.\nWhat is the total population in Merseyside?\n\nsum(df$Population)\n\n[1] 1423287\n\n\nWhat is the total number of full-time students in Merseyside?\n\nsum(df$Full.time.students)\n\n[1] 101538\n\n\nWhich district in Merseyside has the most working population?\n\nmax(df$Working.population)\n\n[1] 205749\n\n\nYes, using max() R returns use the greatest value in Working.population column. If we check back to the dataset, we know it is Liverpool. Instead, we can also ask R to tell us the answer:\n\ndf$District[which.max(df$Working.population)]\n\n[1] Liverpool\nLevels: Knowsley Liverpool Sefton St. Helens Wirral\n\n\nHere, we request R to return the District which has the maximum value of the Working population.\nThen, we can calculate the total number of workers that working from home:\n\nsum(df$Working.from.home)\n\n[1] 159623\n\n\nWhat is the proportion of working population actually work from home in Merseyside? Yes, we need to use a division calculation of the total number of working from home vs. all the working population. R can do it by:\n\nsum(df$Working.from.home) / sum(df$Working.population)\n\n[1] 0.2566443\n\n\nSo the answer is 25.7% for the whole Merseyside - but which district has the highest proportion and which as the lowest? You may have your own guessing. But let R do the calculation:\n\ndf$Prop.WFH = df$Working.from.home / df$Working.population #add a new column called Prop.WFH\ndf #print out the df\n\n    LAD21CD   District Population Households Working.population\n1 E08000011   Knowsley     154519      66073              69495\n2 E08000012  Liverpool     486088     207491             205749\n3 E08000013 St. Helens     183248      81011              82622\n4 E08000014     Sefton     279233     123075             124596\n5 E08000015     Wirral     320199     143253             139500\n  Full.time.students\n1               7050\n2              59628\n3               7582\n4              12636\n5              14642\n  Economic.activity.status..Economically.active..excluding.full.time.students...Unemployed\n1                                                                                     3852\n2                                                                                    13894\n3                                                                                     4076\n4                                                                                     6143\n5                                                                                     6542\n  Age.over.65 Disability No.central.heating Overcrowding Working.from.home\n1       26242      34990               1020         1892             14880\n2       74322     105962               4822         7352             53721\n3       37642      40829               1003         1888             18973\n4       64763      61134               1965         2700             34750\n5       70391      73088               2125         2355             37299\n   Prop.WFH\n1 0.2141161\n2 0.2610997\n3 0.2296362\n4 0.2789014\n5 0.2673763\n\n\nHere we ask R to add a new column named Prop.WFH which is the working from home proportion that calculated by the number of working from home people in each district divided by the total working population in that district. R will automatically do it row-by-row. We then print out the df, you may find at the very right end of the tabular, there is a new column called Prop.WFH.\nYou already know how to get the max of the district by the value, and we can also do that for the minimum:\n\ndf$District[which.max(df$Prop.WFH)]\n\n[1] Sefton\nLevels: Knowsley Liverpool Sefton St. Helens Wirral\n\n\n\ndf$District[which.min(df$Prop.WFH)]\n\n[1] Knowsley\nLevels: Knowsley Liverpool Sefton St. Helens Wirral\n\n\nHave you got the right answer?\n\n\n1.3.1.3 Your first map for Merseyside\nNow let’s try to do our first map in R and allow yourself know more about Merseyside.\nWe will use the library sf and tmap to help us at here. Run the install codes if you haven’t install them. Remember: you will only have to install a package once!!\n\nif (!requireNamespace(\"tmap\")) {\n  install.packages(\"tmap\",dep =TRUE)\n}\n\nLoading required namespace: tmap\n\nif (!requireNamespace(\"sf\")) {\n  install.packages(\"sf\",dep =TRUE)\n}\n\nWhen they have been installed, we can start using them\n\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tmap)\n\nWarning: package 'tmap' was built under R version 4.5.1\n\n\nYou may find in Week 1 data, we have another file named merseyside_districts.gpkg. A GeoPackage (GPKG) is a file-based format designed for storing geographic data. It supports the efficient storage and exchange of spatial datasets and can be readily used across GIS software such as QGIS and ArcGIS, as well as in programming environments including R and Python.\nWe first read it in by using the st_read() command in library sf.\n\nsf &lt;- st_read(\"merseyside_districts.gpkg\")\n\nReading layer `lad_may_2025_uk_bgc_v2_4306843991635065087__lad_may_2025_uk_bgc_v2' from data source `C:\\Users\\ziye\\Documents\\GitHub\\quant\\labs\\merseyside_districts.gpkg' \n  using driver `GPKG'\nSimple feature collection with 5 features and 8 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 318351.7 ymin: 377515.4 xmax: 361796.3 ymax: 422866.5\nProjected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid\n\n\nThe fastest way to map it is the qtm() function.\n\nqtm(sf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also add the district names on the map - which column in the sf contains district name?

    "text": "1.4 Summary\nThe aim of this session has been to familiarise you with the R environment if you have not used R before. If you have but not for a while, then hopefully this has acted as a refresher. Some key things to take away are:\n\nR is a learning curve, and like driving the more your practice the better you become.\nYour job is to try to understand what the code is doing and not to remember the code.\nTo help with this, you should add your own comments to the script to help you understand what is going on when you return to them. Comments are prefaced by a hash (#) that is ignored by R.\nAlways set your working directory to the sub-folder containing your R script.\nAlways run your code from an R script… always!\n\nThe reading for this week is Harris (2016) Chapter 12 up to page 282. You do not have to install any packages (Section 12.2), packages will be introduced in Week 20, but you should try some of the code. Go through the illustrations in Section 12.3 (The Basics of R, starting p253), entering commands with your comments in the script (prep.R) that you created above.\nOptionally you could also briefly read or skim Section 12.3 - the sections are mis-numbered (A Geographical Introduction to R, starting p261), as we will cover these in more detail in subsequent weeks and modules. Go through the Section 12.3 (A Little More about the Workings of R, starting on p268), again entering commands in the script that you created above. Don’t worry about regression (top of p273) we will cover this later, but pay attention to Data Frames (p274), Referencing rows and columns (p275) and Subsetting (p279). Stop at Reading Data (p282).\nOther good on-line get started in R guides include:\n\nThe Owen guide (only up to page 28) : https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Owen-TheRGuide.pdf\nAn Introduction to R - https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Lam-IntroductionToR_LHL.pdf\nR for beginners https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf\n\n\n1.4.1 Formative Tasks\nRecall that a data.frame is a rectangular array of columns of data. Here you will create a data frame of two columns containing numeric values. The following data gives the distance that an elastic band moves when released for each amount it is stretched over the end of a ruler:\n\nelasticband &lt;- data.frame(stretch=c(46,54,48,50,44,42,52),                           \n                          distance=c(148,182,173,166,109,141,166)) \n# have a look \nelasticband\n\n  stretch distance\n1      46      148\n2      54      182\n3      48      173\n4      50      166\n5      44      109\n6      42      141\n7      52      166\n\n\nThe function data.frame() can be used to input these (or other) data directly into data.frame objects.\nTask 1 Plot distance against stretch from the elasticband data frame.\nTask 2 Use the hist() command to plot a histogram of the mpg values in the mtcars data frame. Hints: a) think about how the Hello World plot was parameterised and the fact that histograms are constructed from a single variable, and b) examine the help for hist by entering ?hist at the console.\nTask 3 Repeat 2 after taking logarithms of disp cover using the log() function - i.e. do a histogram of `log(mtcars$mpg)\n\n\n1.4.2 References\nBrunsdon, Chris, and Lex Comber. 2018.
